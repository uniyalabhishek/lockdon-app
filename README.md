LockDon: Commit to a target on-chain! Utilising a locking contract to lock tokens with a set target, we then verify off-chain proof on-chain through vlayer including websites, email, and also other APIs eg. fitness tracker. LockDon is a powerful tool for self improvement, bounties and more! 

Fail to hit your individual set target and get "Wasted"- with your locked token gifted to charity.

Set up a group target with each user locking an amount, and the total being shared between those that met the target.

Set up a bounty to encourage communities to achieve together. Either as part of healthy and novel marketing or as a way to fulfil DAO required tasks.

Sponsor existing targets to support others to meet them, but be refunded should they fail. 

Initial repo: https://github.com/uniyalabhishek/lockdon  (this repo started due to Foundry error)

We built on Polygon zkEVM, using vlayer to authenticate off-chain data from email (via .eml file).
Email sign in and wallet solution was enabled using privy. This data was fed into our smart contract and matched against the expected proof of completion. 

Using our frontend users set their target and timeline and are able to view existing Targets.
