LockDon: Commit to a target on-chain! Utilising a locking contract to lock tokens with a set target, we then verify off-chain proof on-chain through vlayer including websites, email, and also other APIs eg. fitness tracker. LockDon is a powerful tool for self improvement, bounties and more! 

Fail to hit your individual set target and get "Wasted"- with your locked token gifted to charity.

Set up a group target with each user locking an amount, and the total being shared between those that met the target.

Set up a bounty to encourage communities to achieve together. Either as part of healthy and novel marketing or as a way to fulfil DAO required tasks.

Sponsor existing targets to support others to meet them, but be refunded should they fail.
